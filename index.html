    <h3 id="headline">Here's a time line of Mother Teresa's life:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>1910</strong> - Born in Anjezë Gonxhe (or Gonxha)Bojaxhiu</li>
      <li>
        <strong>1928</strong> - Teresa left home at age 18 to join the Sisters of Loreto at Loreto Abbey in Rathfarnham, Ireland, to learn English with the intent of becoming a missionary; 
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1929</strong> - She arrived in India and began her novitiate in Darjeeling, in the lower Himalayas, where she learned Bengali and taught at St. Teresa's School near her convent.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1937</strong> - Teresa took her solemn vows on 14 May while she was a teacher at the Loreto convent school in Entally, eastern Calcutta.She served there for nearly twenty years
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1946</strong> - On 10 September, Teresa experienced what she later described as "the call within the call" when she travelled by train to the Loreto convent in Darjeeling from Calcutta for her annual retreat. "I was to leave the convent and help the poor while living among them. It was an order. To fail would have been to break the faith."Joseph Langford later wrote, "Though no one knew it at the time, Sister Teresa had just become Mother Teresa".
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1948</strong> - She began missionary work with the poor, replacing her traditional Loreto habit with a simple, white cotton sari with a blue border. Teresa adopted Indian citizenship, spent several months in Patna to receive basic medical training at Holy Family Hospital and ventured into the slums. She founded a school in Motijhil, Calcutta, before she began tending to the poor and hungry.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1952</strong> - Teresa opened her first hospice with help from Calcutta officials. She converted an abandoned Hindu temple into the Kalighat Home for the Dying, free for the poor, and renamed it Kalighat, the Home of the Pure Heart (Nirmal Hriday). Those brought to the home received medical attention and the opportunity to die with dignity in accordance with their faith: Muslims were read the Quran, Hindus received water from the Ganges, and Catholics received extreme unction."A beautiful death", Teresa said, "is for people who lived like animals to die like angels—loved and wanted."
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1944</strong> - Rejects a 100% salary increase from Dupont,
        leaves behind his pregnant wife, and flies to Mexico to head a new plant
        pathology program. Over the next 16 years, his team breeds 6,000
        different strains of disease resistent wheat - including different
        varieties for each major climate on Earth.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1945</strong> - Discovers a way to grown wheat twice each
        season, doubling wheat yields
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>1953</strong> - crosses a short, sturdy dwarf breed of wheat
        with a high-yeidling American breed, creating a strain that responds
        well to fertilizer. It goes on to provide 95% of Mexico's wheat.
      </li>
      <li><strong>1979</strong> -Teresa received the Nobel Peace Prize "for work undertaken in the struggle to overcome poverty and distress, which also constitutes a threat to peace". She refused the conventional ceremonial banquet for laureates, asking that its $192,000 cost be given to the poor in India[116] and saying that earthly rewards were important only if they helped her to help the world's needy. </li>
      
      <li>
        <strong>1997</strong> - On 13 March, Teresa resigned as head of the Missionaries of Charity, and she died on 5 September, as news was already overshadowed on the death of Princess Diana a few days earlier. At the time of her death, the Missionaries of Charity had over 4,000 sisters and an associated brotherhood of 300 members operating 610 missions in 123 countries. These included hospices and homes for people with HIV/AIDS, leprosy and tuberculosis, soup kitchens, children's-and family-counselling programmes, orphanages and schools. The Missionaries of Charity were aided by co-workers numbering over one million by the 1990s.

        "Clad in a white sari with a blue border, she and the sisters of Missionaries of Charity became a symbol of hope to many – the aged, the destitute, the unemployed, the diseased, the terminally ill, and those abandoned by their families."
